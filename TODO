Debug the new entity replication framework


Add a client debugger
	Need some way to log messages
	Track entities/chunks

Switch http server to a different backend (preferrably using epoll)
	Mongoose is not very efficiently designed, and doesn't allow for things like persistent sockets/streaming
	Custom HTTP server may be best
		Desired features:
			epoll based implementation
			multithreaded (obviously)
			HTTP compression
			cache all static HTTP responses
			no extra memcpys!

Implement HTTP streaming for heartbeat events!
	This would be awesome, but will probably be too expensive

Introduce some type of precompilation phase for the client code
	Javascript should be statically checked (to the extent that it is possible)
	Also:
		Minified
		Optimized
	Maybe try Closure from google?
	Other note: JSLint is a terrible tool, it seems to mostly enforce the author's own prejuidices while providing little in the way of any substantial performance/safety guarantees.
		Other lint style checkers seem to be equally terrible


Need to test code on other platforms:
	Firefox 4
	Opera
	(IE support is not going to happen, at least until MS commits to supporting webgl)
